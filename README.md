# NviMaster
Nvimaster is a web app that helps users learn how to navigate inside a configurable and lightweight text/code editor called Neovim.

## Libraries used:
- [Tailwind Css](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
- [Preline UI](https://www.preline.co/docs/index.html)

## Why learn Neovim?
Neovim offers a customizable and feature-rich experience you will not get with any other text editor(except maybe Vim).
It offers: 
- Installing plugins using various package managers(lazy.nvim, packer.nvim...), using Lua syntax
- Install plugins using Vimscript instead of Lua(if you're coming from Vim)
- Keyboard-centric workflow(no mouse required)
- Minimalism(it can be as complicated as you configure it to be)
